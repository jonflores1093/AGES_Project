# AGES_Project
Simple midterm project to demonstrate knowledge of Unity.

This project is a Ball Maze.

The main mechanic of this short game is to demonstarte the use of random generator to display a different maze every start of the game.
The ball will have a third person controller attached and have the ability to jump slightly to avoid some obstacles.

The goal of the game is to get the ball to the end of the maze.
